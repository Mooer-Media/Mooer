# To do
- Moderation(bans, kicks, account deletion, mutes, reporting posts). This requires
- more account data(ban status, moderation level, is muted, date created, description)
- Saving and loading past posts. Use a post ID system and a massive json thing for this
- More post data(is deleted, report amounts, post ID of what it's responding to)
- (to get around replying system, maybe just append <@username >text\nReply>?)
- Post formatting
- **TEXT ENGINE**
- Storing user data in a server thing
- PFP system(gonna ask plates to draw some of those, maybe some custom PFPs for mods?)
- Quack sound effect when you recieve a message
- Menus(login/sign up, account stuff)
- Changelog
- Better password encryption than what we have now(edit: do I really want to implement SHA3-512? https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/281984950/)
- Make a logo(maybe ask plates or pathos for that? i suck at drawing)
